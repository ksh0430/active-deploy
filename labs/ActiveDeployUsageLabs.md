# Active Deploy Scenario Labs

These lab steps will walk you through a full set of usage scenarios for Active Deploy.


**Notes**
* Since Active Deploy has both a **Dashboard user interface**, and a **full command line interface**, you can choose either lab type depending on how you want to work - they both function the same way.
* The labs work for both Cloud Foundry Applications and Container "compute instances". If there are specific instructions they will be labeled "CONTAINERS:" or "CFAPPS:"

##Before you Start
* Learn about [Active Deploy Overview and Concepts](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/active-deploy/tree/master/labs/ActiveDeployUsageLabs-Lab0-Overview.md)
* Satisfy the 1-time [prerequisites](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/active-deploy/tree/master/labs/ActiveDeployUsageLabs-Lab0-Prereqs.md)
* Create a [Sample Application](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/active-deploy/tree/master/labs/ActiveDeployUsageLabs-Lab0-SampleApp.md) if you are not already using an application you've created
