# Active Deploy Scenario Labs

These lab steps will walk you through a full set of usage scenarios for Active Deploy. Since Active Deploy has both a **user interface dashboard**, and a **full command line interface**, you can choose either lab type depending on how you want to work - they both function the same way.


**Notes**
* The labs work for both Cloud Foundry Applications and Container "compute instances". If there are specific instructions they will be labeled "CONTAINERS:" or "CFAPPS:"
