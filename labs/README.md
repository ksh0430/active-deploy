# Active Deploy Scenario Labs

These labs will walk you through a full set of usage scenarios for Active Deploy.


**Notes**
* Since Active Deploy has both a **Dashboard user interface**, and a **full command line interface**, you can choose either lab type depending on how you want to work - they both function the same way.
* The labs work for both Cloud Foundry Applications and Container "compute instances". If there are specific instructions they will be labeled "CONTAINERS:" or "CFAPPS:"

## Before you Start
* Learn about [Active Deploy Overview and Concepts](Lab0-Overview.md)
* Satisfy the one-time [prerequisites](Lab0-Prereqs.md)
* [Create a Sample Application](Lab0-SampleApp.md) if you are not already using an application you've created, or use one of our provided sample applications.
