# Active Deploy Service Plugin for Bluemix Delivery Pipeline Service

## Try me 
A simple Hello World Python application using Flask on Bluemix
Press this button, to get your own copy of the sample running in Bluemix! It clones the project, creates DevOps Services Project, generates multi-stage pipeline, deploys application to IBM Bluemix.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/Puquios/active-deploy.git)

## Let's Get Started
This simple pipeline demonstrates how active deploy capabilities can be used within Bluemix Delivery Pipeline services. Once you press the "Deploy to Bluemix" button and log in, you should see a set of steps run through:

    Created project successfully
    Cloned repository successfully
    Configured pipeline successfully
    Deployed to Bluemix successfully

Once completed, you should click on the "edit code" button and then "Build & Deploy" in the upper right hand corner.

Here you will see a Build & Deploy pipeline - full info on this awesome DevOps capability can be found [here](https://hub.jazz.net/docs/deploy/).

  - Build stage
    - The first stage is the build stage - that is the standard build stage in Bluemix - however you create your application image in a pipeline is what would be done here. 
  - Deploy stage
    - The second stage is where the Active Deploy magic happens. The first time this project runs runs, Active Deploy won't run yet - but it will gave you a sample application running properly that you can now use to run Active Deploy to show you have the pipeline integration works. The Active Deploy pipeline stage information is fully described [here] (https://github.ibm.com/smguilia/shawna-staging/blob/master/extension.md).

1. The first time you run this:
  - Deploys the app as a Cloud Foundry application to Bluemix 
  - if you run from a command line (link to command line set up lab in our labs) ```cf apps``` you will see this application running:
    
    ```
      $ cf apps
      Getting apps in org ORGNAME / space dev as USERNAME...
      OK

      name                             requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
      active-deploy-ORGNAME-936_1      started           3/3         64M      1G     active-deploy-ORGNAME-936.mybluemix.net
    ```
    
    or something similar - this is your initial sample application. Or you can look at the Bluemix console dashboard @ console.ng.bluemix.net to see your new application running.

2. The second time you run it:
  If you execute the build stage again with the little arrow, it will re-execute the build, create a new image, and then re-run the Active Deploy Stage. This actually runs the Active Deploy this time through. You can see your deploy happening using these commands (adjusted for your results in command above):
    ```
      $ cf active-deploy-list | grep "in_progress"
      $ cf active-deploy-show active-deploy-ORGNAME-936_1-to-active-deploy-ORGNAME-936_2
    ```
Or you can look at the Active Deploy Console dashboard @ console.ng.bluemix.net => Services => Active Deploy.

You're Done

That's it, you've now seen Active Deploy work in the Bluemix Build & Delivery Pipeline. The next step for you is to set it up in your own pipeline project.
